# webpack-4-starter-kit

* A simple webpack config to start your project faster
* Git clone or copy/paste the project
* 'cd your_project_name'
* 'npm install'
* 'npm run dev' to start dev mode or 'npm run build' to build your project
* Work in 'src/assets' folder
* Web dev server will come later, for the moment, run index.html (./dist folder)
